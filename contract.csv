""

"THIS MASTER AGREEMENT, made and entered into this first day of September"
"2017 by and between the CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION (hereinafter"
"referred to as “the Association”), and KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITALS and"
"THE PERMANENTE MEDICAL GROUP, INC. (hereinafter collectively referred"
"to as “Employer”), covers all Registered Nurses (hereinafter referred to as"
"“Nurses”), in those classifications specified in Article XXIII who are employed in"
"existing facilities of the Employer located in Northern California."
""
"PREAMBLE"
""
"Nurses and Kaiser Permanente agree to promote optimal patient outcomes and to"
"adhere to applicable state and federal statutes related to the delivery of health"
"care."
""
"100   ARTICLE I – RECOGNITION"
""
"101   The Association, having established that it has been designated collective"
"bargaining agent by a majority of the Nurses covered by this Agreement, is"
"hereby recognized by the Employer as the sole bargaining agent"
"representing such Nurses (including Interim Permittees; and nurses as"
"described in NLRB Case No. 20-RC-188438 (2016)) for the purpose of"
"collective bargaining with respect to wages, hours, and other conditions of"
"employment."
""
"102   The parties agree that competent performance of the essential functions of"
"bargaining unit direct care Registered Nurses (RNs) and Nurse Practitioners"
"(NPs) as determined by Registered nursing and hospital licensing law"
"and regulation, requires the application of scientific knowledge and"
"technical skill in the physical, social and biological sciences and the"
"exercise of independent, discretionary judgment by the direct care RN/NP"
"in the interest of the assigned patient."
""
"103   Therefore, the Employer agrees it will not challenge the bargaining unit"
"status of any Nurse or job classification covered by this Agreement, claim"
"that any Nurse or job classification covered by this Agreement exercises"
"supervisory authority within the meaning of the NLRA, assign duties to or"
"remove direct patient care duties and responsibilities from any Nurse for"
"the purpose of removing that Nurse from the bargaining unit, or eliminate"
"or remove from bargaining unit nurses the direct care responsibilities of"
"Registered Nurses and Nurse Practitioners described in the preceding"
"paragraph. Finally, the Employer also agrees that during the term of this"
"Agreement it will not challenge the Union’s right to represent any Nurse in"
"any job classification covered by this Agreement based on a claim that"
"such Nurse is a supervisor within the meaning of the NLRA."
"1"
"104   Disputes concerning this provision may be referred directly to an expedited"
"arbitration. The sole issue in any such arbitration shall be whether the"
"Employer violated the commitments set forth in paragraph 103 of the"
"Agreement. If the Employer is found to have violated paragraph 103, the"
"sole remedies shall be restoration of the status quo ante, and a make-"
"whole remedy for the affected bargaining unit nurses. The arbitrator shall"
"issue a written decision within fourteen (14) days after conclusion of the"
"hearing. No extensions shall be granted without mutual agreement."
""
"200   ARTICLE II – COVERAGE"
""
"201   The Nurses covered by this Agreement are those Nurses who can legally"
"practice as graduate Registered Nurses who are employed by the"
"Employer to perform nursing service, including Interim Permittees, but"
"excluding Nurses engaged in research activities or Nurses holding"
"administrative or executive positions who have the authority to hire,"
"discipline or discharge Nurses or other personnel, or to effectively"
"recommend such action."

"Section A – Required Membership"

"this Agreement become and remain members in good standing of the"
"Association. It shall also be a condition of employment that all employees"
"covered by this Agreement and hired on or after its execution date shall,"
