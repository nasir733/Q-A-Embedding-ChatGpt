F – Float Department,"520 Each Medical Center shall establish a Float Department. There shall be the 
option to create a Float Department in the outpatient clinics based on

Provide hospitals and outpatient clinics a deployable, flexible 
RN/NP staff based on operational needs. 
Provide flexible work environments for RNs/NPs. 
Assist in providing sufficient staff for census fluctuations, and 
vacations, education, sick, and other leave replacements. 
Principles

to more than two (2) distinct nursing units, but shall not be required 
to do so. A regional task force comprised of nursing administration 
and RNQLs will develop guidelines to assist hospitals and 
outpatient clinics in identifying distinct nursing units within six (6) 
months of ratification of the collective bargaining agreement. 
Have an orientation individualized to each member of the Float 
Department based on current competencies and experience level. 
Be provided the opportunity to request additional shifts that shall be 
assigned by seniority within this department.

units and shall be assigned by seniority after RNs/NPs who have 
requested additional shifts in their own units. 
Bidding rights shall be in accordance with the collective bargaining 
agreement, Article IX – Position and Filling of Vacancies,"
,"A – Posting, paragraph 901 of the agreement."
G – Voluntary Floating,"Floating Outside Home and/or Float Department Assignments 
524 In order to expand operational flexibility, the Employer proposes 
implementing the following Volunteer Floating process. Kaiser Foundation 
Hospitals will commit to the implementation of the agreed to Voluntary Float 
process. 
525 The Permanente Medical Group by facility, reserves the right to determine 
which process would best accomplish its needs, to include Float 
Department, or Voluntary Float; a combination of both. The 
implementation of the Voluntary Floating Process will void Appendix J, 
Floating of the 2006 Master Agreement. In the administration of this 
paragraph it is understood that Nurses who float shall receive 5% 
differential applied to the Nurse’s base rate. In those facilities where 
floating occurs, a voluntary floating list will be maintained. 
526 The minimum qualifications for floating within KFH or TPMG are Clinical 
Competency in a minimum of two (2) distinct nursing units."
13 Order for Floating to Designated Paired Units,"527 The order for floating to the identified paired units will be: 
• Volunteers from the Volunteer List. Selection would be by seniority 
without regard to rotation. 
• Volunteers who are not on the Volunteer List by seniority. Such 
volunteers will receive float differential for the full shift during which 
they were floated. 
• Registry/Travelers 
• Per Diem Nurses and Nurses working additional shifts, by inverse 
seniority. 
• Scheduled Nurses, working their regularly scheduled shift, by 
inverse seniority. 
528 Volunteer Process 
1. An initial voluntary sign-up list will be created for nurses interested in 
floating in the above mentioned affected units. Nurses will be notified 
two (2) weeks prior to the posting of the sign-up sheet which will be 
posted in a designated binder in each unit’s conference room. The 
list will be made available for two (2) weeks. 
2. Nurses will sign up for a twelve (12) week commitment. 
3. Nurses can add themselves to the volunteer list on an ongoing basis. 
4. Volunteers commit to a twelve (12) week period. Nurses may 
submit a notice to remove themselves from the list at any time, 
with a minimum of thirty (30) days notice, but must fulfill their twelve 
(12) week requirement. 
5. An RN may request to terminate his/her twelve (12) week obligation 
prior to fulfilling the twelve (12) weeks which will be considered on 
a case-by-case basis. The Employer and the Union will meet to 
discuss the individual requests and circumstances. For orientation 
training purpose s, a replacement RN will be identified prior to the 
termination date. Approvals will be by mutual agreement."
14 Designated Float RNs by Inverse Seniority,"529 Should the volunteer list be insufficient or volunteers decline to float, to 
meet the needed number of float RNs per unit as listed above, volunteers 
who have not signed up on the Volunteer list will be solicited and selected 
by seniority; Registry and Traveler Nurses, Per diems and Nurses working 
additional shifts and finally regularly scheduled Nurses on the shift, by 
inverse seniority order will be assigned. Under no circumstances will 
nurses be floated prior to receiving orientation as provided for in #6: 
Orientation for Floating Purposes Only. 
530 Float exemption: No nurse with less than six (6) months experience in 
her/his home unit will float. Nurses who volunteer for an additional shift, in 
accordance with paragraph 810 of this agreement outside his/her home 
department, will not be paid Float differential. 
Float Guidelines 
531 The float Guidelines are developed in order to improve morale among the 
RNs and minimize involuntary floating in units. 
532 1. Every nurse who floats outside her/his home unit as defined in # 5 
below will be compensated with a 5% differential in accordance 
with Order of Floating to Paired Units, above. 
533 2. If a nurse is floated and works overtime she/he will continue to 
receive the 5% differential applied to the Nurse’s base pay. 
534 3. The Employer will make every reasonable effort to avoid “double 
floating” and to float Nurses not more than one (1) time per shift. The 
employer may return the float RN to her/his home unit based on 
operational need. However, if the float RN is returned to the home 
unit she/he will not be required to float again during that shift. 
535 4. The option to float will be provided to nurses designated and oriented 
as float nurses on shift and awarded to the most senior according to 
the “Order for Floating” language. If there are no nurses on the 
Voluntary Float List then the Order for Floating to Designated Paired 
Units will apply. Under no circumstances will nurses be floated 
without proper orientation as provided for in #6.   
536 5. The definition of floating will be movement from one distinct nursing 
unit/department/clinic to another.  Examples of floating are, but not 
limited to, ICU to Med Surg; Med Surg to Peds or Dermatology to 
Emergency Department. Units/departments/clinics with the same 
or similar clinical competencies, but located within the same 
Medical Center/Medical Office Building, will not be considered part 
of the float pairs.  Examples of non- eligible floating differential are"
15 Med Surg North to Med Surg South or from one Primary Care Unit,"to another Primary Care Unit. 
Orientation for floating purposes only: 
537 6. Nurses subject to floating will be thoroughly oriented into the 
designated float unit by a designated Staff Nurse Orienteer prior 
to taking a patient assignment. The Staff Nurse Orienteer will not 
have a patient assignment during orientation. 
538 If needed, Nurses will be provided up to 8 hours of orientation to the 
paired float unit, if necessary, with the exception of ICU to CMU, 
ICU nurses will be provided up to 4 hours of orientation. 
Orientation is defined as those elements contained in the normal 
orientation of Nurses new to the unit and is not intended to include 
clinical competence training. It is expected that Nurses to be 
oriented to the new/additional unit/clinic already posses s the 
required clinical competencies. 
539 Such orientation will be conducted in small groups. No more than 
4 RNs will be assigned to one Staff Nurse Orienteer for orientation. 
540 Orientation shall not be provided to any Registered Nurse who has 
worked in any of the units identified within the last (6) months. Any 
issue related to the need for orientation for the nurse with such 
prior experience shall be evaluated by the RN and the employer on 
a case-by-case basis. 
541 The Voluntary Float Process does not impact or affect the Multi 
Medical Center/Multi Site Agreement or operation of the Float 
Departments in the Master Agreement. 
Required Competencies 
542 To be in accordance with, but not limited to, California Statutes and the 
Employer’s Orientation Policy.

(1) or more years of service and Regular full-time Nurses on the evening 
shift with four (4) or more years of service with the Employer shall have 
the right to elect a regularly scheduled four-shift week. Such Nurses shall 
be compensated at four- fifths (4/5ths) of their regular weekly salary, and"
"G – Weekends Off, shall be applicable. A Nurse","exercising this option shall be granted two (2) consecutive night or evening 
shifts off, respectively, each week. Where a facility has had a more liberal 
consecutive days off program for Nurses working four (4) nights or 
evenings a week, such more liberal program shall not be revised by 
reason of the foregoing provision. The Employer shall make a good faith 
effort to accommodate other requests from RNs/NPs to increase or 
decrease scheduled hours to promote work/life balance. 
Implementation 
706 Regular full-time Nurses eligible to elect the above options shall be placed 
on such schedule as promptly as the vacancy created by the Nurse's 
election to reduce nights or evenings of work can be satisfactorily filled. 
It is the intention of the Parties, insofar as it is practical and possible, to 
reschedule the Nurse no later than thirty (30) days from the election 
notification by the Nurse to the Employer."
C – Overtime,"No Mandatory Overtime 
707 There shall be no mandatory overtime except during a state of emergency 
declared by City, County, State or Federal authorities, or during a short-
term (not to exceed 24 hours) City or County mandatory diversion override. 
In the event of such a state of emergency or diversion override, the 
Facility/Facilities will take all reasonable steps to utilize volunteers and to 
obtain coverage from other sources prior to mandating overtime. 
Overtime Defined 
708 If a Nurse works in excess of forty (40) hours in any one payroll week, or 
eight (8) hours in any one payroll day, or in excess of eight (8) hours in 
consecutive time excluding meal period, such Nurse shall be paid at time 
and one-half (1 1/2) the Nurse's straight-time rate for such work in 
excess of eight (8) hours, or as otherwise defined in"
"E, Alternative","Shifts. 
709 Double the employee's regular straight-time hourly rate of pay shall be paid 
for all hours worked in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours, excluding 
meal period. 
Authorization of Overtime 
710 All overtime worked must be paid according to State Labor Law. All 
overtime worked by a Nurse should be authorized in advance if possible, 
otherwise the claim for overtime shall be subject to review. If it is not 
possible on the day overtime is worked to secure authorization in advance,"
"19 the Nurse shall record the overtime on the day overtime is worked, and the","reasons therefore on a record made available by the facility, and given to 
the Supervisor at the earliest opportunity. 
Lunch Period and Payment for Lunch Time Worked 
711 Full shift Nurses working the day and evening shifts who are scheduled 
to work eight (8) hours within a spread of eight and one-half (8 1/2) hours 
shall receive not less than one-half (1/2) hour for lunch. If such Nurse is 
required to work during the lunch period, such lunch period shall be paid as 
time worked in addition to payment for the full shift and shall be deemed 
time worked for the purpose of computing overtime.  This provision does 
not prevent a night shift Nurse from working eight (8) hours within eight 
(8) hours without a meal period and eating at the Nurse's station, so long 
as in such cases the eight (8) hours are compensable time. 
712 Should a Nurse anticipate the inability to take a lunch break (except for 
night shift Nurses who have elected eight hours of work in lieu of a 
meal period) at the regularly scheduled time due to workload 
requirements, he or she shall make all reasonable efforts to notify the 
responsible supervisor. Should the Employer be unable to provide an 
appropriate lunch break, it shall comply with applicable state law governing 
Employer responsibilities when the lunch break is missed. 
Timekeeping 
713 The uniform method of the Kaiser Medical Care Program in Northern 
California applies to Nurses under the jurisdiction of this Agreement. At this 
time a summary of the system is as follows:  Time in and time out are 
recorded to the nearest five (5) minutes and total hours worked are 
recorded in hours and tenths of hours. Minutes worked in excess of an 
even hour will be converted to tenths on the basis of the conversion table 
appearing on the time card and illustrated below. 
Overtime Conversion Table 
714 Daily Conversion Table - Minutes to Tenths 
5 .1 20 .3 35 .6 50 .8
10 .2 25 .4 40 .7 55 .9
15 .3 30 .5 45 .8
Inclusion of Differentials 
715 Split shift differential shall be included in the calculation of overtime pay 
eligibility."
20 Distribution of Daily Overtime,"716 Daily overtime will be offered to Registered Nurses on each shift and 
each unit based on seniority. For the purposes of this paragraph, daily 
overtime is defined as not more than four (4) hours before or after the 
employee’s regular shift. 
No Duplication of Overtime Payments 
717 There shall be no duplication of overtime payments for the same hours 
worked under any of the provisions of this Agreement, and to the extent 
that hours are compensated for at overtime rates under one provision, they 
shall not be counted as hours worked in determining overtime under the 
same or any other provision."
D – Rest Periods,"718 Each Nurse shall be granted a rest period of fifteen (15) minutes during 
each half shift without deduction in pay. 
719 Should a Nurse anticipate the inability to take a rest break at the 
regularly scheduled time due to workload requirements, he or she shall 
make all reasonable efforts to notify the responsible supervisor. Should 
the Employer be unable to provide a work break as described above, it 
shall comply with applicable state law governing Employer responsibilities 
when the break is missed."
E – Alternative Shifts,"720 The Parties agree that the RN/NP working a ten-hour shift in a round-the-
clock unit shall work a regular eight (8) hour shift and the two additional 
hours shall be used either as a Resource Nurse or to fulfill other clinical 
responsibilities based upon unit/department requirements. 
721 The Employer may post ten (10) or twelve (12) hour shifts in any unit in 
accordance with the following: 
Posted ten (10) and twelve (12) hour shifts shall include shift differential 
in accordance with paragraph 2341 or 2342 based on the shift during 
which the majority of hours are worked. 
RNs/NPs in a ten (10) or twelve (12) hour shift position shall be paid pro-
rated holiday pay up to eight (8) hours maximum per holiday based on 
their FTE status for holidays that fall on a regularly scheduled day off.   
All regular hours worked by a RN/NP in a ten (10) or twelve (12) hour shift 
will be paid at the RNs/NPs straight time rate, plus applicable differential,"
21 except when that shift falls on a contractually recognized holiday per,"paragraph 2801. For shifts worked on a holiday, the Nurse shall be paid in 
accordance with paragraphs 2813 and 2815 as appropriate, and any 
 “additional day off” shall be ten (10) or twelve (12) hours in accordance 
with the nurse’s regular schedule. 
RNs/NPs in ten (10) or twelve (12) hour positions shall be entitled to bid on 
open positions at any time, without regard to the six (6) month bar in 
paragraph 913. 
With four (4) weeks notice, if an employee working a ten (10) or twelve (12) 
hour shift requests a change to an eight (8) hour shift, such employee shall 
be returned to his/her prior unit and shift. 
No medical center shall post or fill more than 25% of its RN/NP positions as 
twelve (12) hour shifts under this provision without the written agreement 
of the Association."
F – Every Weekend Position,"722 Every Weekend positions are defined as requiring the Nurse to work at least 
one (1) shift every weekend. All Short-Hour, Part-Time and Full-Time 
Nurses are eligible for Every Weekend Positions. 
723 Requirements for Implementation 
RNs/NPs who are awarded posted Every Weekend positions will receive 
a 10% weekend differential in addition to their regular base wage rate for all 
hours worked, including non-weekend and extra hours. For purposes of this 
paragraph, weekend hours include all hours between the shift change time 
closest to 11:00 p.m. Friday and the shift change time closest to 8:00 a.m. 
Monday. 
Positions designated as Every Weekend require the RNs/NPs to work, 
or be available to work, at least forty-six (46) out of fifty-two (52) weekends 
per calendar year (unless the RN/NP has more accrued vacation, is off 
work due to Workers Compensation or has a disability as defined by State 
law). 
724 Under no circumstance will any RN/NP who is awarded an Every 
Weekend position be eligible for the third weekend penalty pay referenced 
in paragraph 728 of the Agreement."
G – Weekends Off,"Definition of Weekend 
725 Except as provided in paragraph 728, a weekend means Saturday and 
Sunday, (Friday and Saturday for night shifts). 
Guarantee of Weekends Off 
726 The Employer will use its best efforts to grant each Regular full and part-time 
Nurse every other weekend off, and will guarantee that each Nurse will 
not be required to work more than two (2) consecutive weekends in a row. 
The above weekend off provisions may be waived on the written request 
of the individual Nurse. For purposes of this paragraph, “work” means time 
actually worked by such Nurse. 
No Reduction of More Liberal Policy 
727 The Employer will not change a more liberal policy now in effect. 
Scheduling and Payment of Third Consecutive Weekends 
728 In the administration of third weekend penalty pay, the weekend will be 
defined as either Saturday or Sunday (Friday or Saturday for night shift). 
In order to qualify for third weekend pay, the Nurse must perform work 
on the second of three consecutive weekend periods, i.e. any work on 
either Saturday or Sunday, in accordance with the provisions of this 
paragraph. All hours worked on the third and following consecutive 
weekends shall be paid at the penalty rate and payment shall be made for 
any time actually worked by such Nurse. The Employer reserves the 
contractual right to utilize employees for weekend work for which the 
penalty would not apply, including but not limited to (a) employees who 
have waived the penalty, (b) employees available for work on a non-
premium basis, and (c) employees available for work on a premium 
(overtime) basis but not a penalty basis. If a Nurse does not waive third 
weekend pay when he/she volunteers for work for a weekend that occurs 
between two regularly scheduled weekends, and that Nurse is bypassed 
for the second weekend by management in anticipation of and in order to 
prevent the liability of third weekend penalty pay, the Parties agree that 
there is no contract violation. Hours worked on a scheduled Friday evening 
shift that normally ends after midnight Saturday morning will not count as 
weekend hours. However, any additional hours worked after the normal 
shift ends will count as weekend hours."
23 Waiver in Case of Catastrophe,"729 In the event of a major catastrophe, the California Nurses Association will 
waive any penalty payment provided for above."
H – Rest Between Shifts,"730 Each Regular Nurse shall have an unbroken rest period of at least twelve 
(12) hours between shifts, and of at least fifty-five (55) hours between shifts 
when the Nurse is off on the weekend or two (2) consecutive days off, and 
of at least thirty- one (31) hours between shifts when the Nurse is off on 
a holiday or on a single day off. All hours worked within the above rest 
periods shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2). This provision 
may be waived on the request of the individual Nurse and with the 
agreement of the supervisor. Overtime for which premium pay is given 
shall count as rest periods for purposes of this paragraph."
I – Premium for Sixth (6th) Day Worked Within the Same Work-,"Week 
731 Nurses assigned to a scheduled workweek of twenty (20) hours or more in a 
period of more than five (5) work days shall be paid at the rate of time and 
one-half (1 1/2) for all hours of work actually performed on the sixth (6th) 
day of work. Eligibility for such premium payment shall not be applicable: 
(1) to any Nurse who does not actually work at least twenty (20) hours in 
any payroll week for any reason or (2) during any week a Nurse does not 
actually work a sixth (6th) day for any reason or (3) if such work was 
established primarily as an accommodation to the Nurse. Sixth (6th) day 
worked within the same work week premium may be waived subject to Call 
Back from Stand-By."
J – Premium Pay After Seven Consecutive Days of Work,"732 A Nurse who works more than seven (7) consecutive days without a day 
off shall be compensated thereafter at time and one-half (1 1/2) for each 
day worked or portion thereof until granted a day off. This provision may be 
waived on the request of an individual Nurse and with the agreement of 
the Supervisor as provided in"
K – Waivers,"The above Article VII,"
H – Rest Between,"Shifts,"
I – Premiums for Sixth (6th) Day Worked Within the Same,Work Week and
J – Premium Pay After Seven Consecutive Days,"of Work may be waived on the request of an individual Nurse and with 
the agreement of the supervisor. The facility shall maintain a record of 
such agreement, in either electronic or paper format. Such requests for"
24 waiver shall be in writing and the individual Nurse shall indicate the time,"period during which such waiver shall be in effect. The facility shall furnish a 
copy of such written waiver to the Nurse Representative at that facility 
designated by the Association for such purpose."
L – Premium Pay for Seventh Consecutive Day,"733 Employees shall be paid at the rate of double the straight time hourly rate, 
including shift differential and split shift differential, for all hours performed 
on the seventh (7th) consecutive day worked within the payroll week."
M – Posting of Work Schedules,"734 Nurses will be provided with a fixed schedule in no less than four week 
cycles with the work schedules and days off posted no less than 
fourteen (14) days in advance. Fixed schedules shall be consistent 
from month to month with a weekend pattern, where applicable, 
including weekends off in accordance with"
G. Fixed schedules,"shall be posted in designated areas of the facility as mutually agreed to by 
the Union and the Employer at said facility. At such time as is operationally 
feasible, Nurses’ fixed work schedules shall be posted online. 
735 For proposed changes to fixed schedules, the Employer will first seek 
volunteers in the department who wish to change their schedule. If there 
are no volunteers, the Employer shall notify the Union, to include, but not 
limited to: the reason for the change; the potentially affected Nurses and 
the planned effective date. Upon the Union’s request, the parties shall 
meet to discuss or bargain prior to the planned effective date for the 
purposes of identifying volunteers and/or review of scheduling alternatives 
that may otherwise meet the Employer’s needs. Any changes in the 
Employer’s scheduling plans shall be by mutual agreement. 
736 Regular work schedules shall not be changed to avoid payment of the 
holiday pay or overtime, or to require an extra day of work for the Nurse. 
This provision shall not affect Article XXVIII,"
A – Recognized,"Holidays, paragraph 2807, guaranteeing each Regular Nurse at least 
one of the following holidays off: Christmas Day and New Year's Day. 
IRP Schedules for Appointment and Advice Call Centers 
737 1. All AACC RN variable day IRP (internal replacement pool) positions will 
be eliminated by June 30, 2007. Accomplishment of this goal will be 
achieved by:"
"25 a. Effective September 1, 2006 no new variable day IRP","positions will be posted. 
b. Beginning in September 1, 2006, minimally 10% of these 
positions will be reduced monthly, culminating in June 2007. 
2. Effective June 30, 2007, all RN variable start IRP positions will be 
reduced from a 2 hour variable start to 1.5 hours. 
3. Prior to moving any RN IRP staff, volunteers will be solicited to 
make schedule adjustments. In the event volunteers are not 
identified, IRP RN staff, by inverse seniority, will receive 4 weeks 
notice prior to having their schedules modified. 
4. Effective June 30, 2007, no greater than 25% of the RN staff at each 
of the AACC’s will have variable start positions."
N – Reporting Pay,"738 Nurses who are scheduled to report for work, and who are permitted to 
come to work without receiving prior notice that no work is available in 
their regular assignment, shall perform any nursing work to which they may 
be assigned. When the Employer is unable to utilize such Nurse and the 
reason for lack of work is within the control of the Employer, the Nurse 
shall be paid an amount equivalent to eight (8) hours times the straight-
time hourly rate plus applicable shift differential; provided that a Nurse 
who was scheduled to work less than eight (8) hours on such a day shall 
be paid for the Nurse's regularly scheduled number of hours for reporting 
and not being put to work through no fault of the Nurse. The provisions of 
this"
shall not apply if the lack of work is not within the control of the,"Employer or if the Employer makes a reasonable effort to notify the Nurse 
by telephone not to report for work at least two (2) hours before the 
Nurse's scheduled time to work. 
739 The Employer shall not cancel a regular shift and then offer the canceled 
employee a partial shift of four (4) or more hours. The Employer can notify 
the Nurse that instead of him/her being canceled, a full shift is being offered 
but some of the hours can be for nursing duties ""as assigned"" at the 
Employer's discretion and for which the employee is qualified to perform. 
740 It is understood that the No Cancellation Letter of Agreement shall 
supersede the above where conflicts exist between paragraphs 739 
and/or 740 and specific provisions of the No Cancellation Letter of 
Agreement so long as such Letter of Agreement remains in effect. 
741 It shall be the responsibility of the Nurse to notify the Employer of the 
Nurse's current address and telephone number. Failure to do so shall"
"26 preclude the Employer from the notification requirements, and the payment","of the above minimum guarantee. If a Nurse is terminated and is not 
notified before the start of the next shift that the Nurse would have worked 
otherwise, the Nurse shall receive four (4) hours' pay in accordance with 
the provision of this"
.,"742 If a Nurse, other than Regular full-time is called to work on what would 
otherwise have been a regularly scheduled day off, and if the Employer 
fails to give one (1) hour's notice before the start of the required shift, the 
Nurse shall be paid for the hours of work actually performed plus one (1) 
hour but not to exceed eight (8) hours pay in any one (1) shift unless the 
Nurse works more than eight (8) hours in that shift."
O – Absence Notification,"743 Any Nurse who is unable to report to work on any scheduled shift 
shall use reasonable efforts to notify her/his supervisor of the inability to 
report at least two (2) hours prior to the start of the scheduled shift."
P – Travel Time,"744 Nurses required to travel for Employer business will be paid travel time in 
accordance with federal and state wage and hour laws. Compensable travel 
time includes travel as a driver of a vehicle, or as a passenger in a vehicle 
or public transportation. 
745 The employee’s normal “home-to-work” commute time is not considered 
hours worked and is not compensable. This includes the one-way 
commute leaving home at the beginning of the trip and the one-way 
commute returning home at the end of the trip. 
746 If a Nurse reports to a regularly assigned work site and is then required to 
travel to another site to work for the day, travel time to and from the work 
sites is considered compensable travel time and will be paid. 
747 If a Nurse is given a work assignment in another location, any travel time in 
excess of the regular “home to work” commute time is considered hours 
worked and is compensable travel time and will be paid. 
748 Compensable travel time counts as hours worked for purposes of overtime 
calculations."
Q – Mileage,"749 Nurses required to travel for Employer business will be reimbursed for 
business use of personal cars according to the Employer’s current standard 
mileage rate in effect at the time of travel. Reasonable costs for taxis or"
27 public transportation and other travel related expenses such as parking,"fees and tolls are also subject to reimbursement. 
750 The employee’s normal “home-to-work” commute mileage is not eligible 
for reimbursement. This includes the one-way commute leaving home at 
the beginning of the trip and the one-way commute returning home at the 
end of the trip. 
751 If a Nurse reports to their regularly assigned work site and is then required 
to travel to another site to work for the day, mileage to and from the work 
sites is eligible for reimbursement. 
752 If a Nurse’s work assignment is at other than their regularly assigned work 
site and they travel to that other site without reporting to their normal site 
first, then the mileage in excess of the regular “home to work” commute 
mileage is eligible for reimbursement. 
800 ARTICLE VIII – SENIORITY"
"A – Seniority, Accumulation and Application","801 Regular Nurses and Short-Hour, Temporary and Per diem Nurses shall have 
equal seniority for transfers, promotions, and layoffs based upon their 
bargaining unit seniority. 
802 Regular Nurses shall accumulate seniority based upon length of continuous 
service with the Employer under this Agreement. Effective September 1, 
2002, Short-Hour, Temporary and Per diem Nurses shall accumulate 
seniority on the basis of eighty-seven (87) hours of work equaling one (1) 
month's seniority credit, for hours worked after September 1, 2002 except 
that no Nurse shall receive more than one (1) month's seniority credit in any 
one (1) calendar month. Credit for hours worked prior to September 1, 2002 
shall be on the basis of one hundred forty five (145) hours work equaling 
one (1) month’s seniority credit. When a Nurse changes status, the following 
adjustments shall apply with respect to seniority accumulation: 
Effective September 1, 2002, a Regular Nurse whose status is 
changed to Short-Hour, Temporary and Per diem shall have 
seniority earned as a Regular Nurse credited to Short-Hour, 
Temporary and Per diem status on the basis of one (1) month 
equaling eighty-seven (87) hours for all hours worked after 
September 1, 2002. Seniority credit for hours worked prior to 
September 1, 2002 shall be credited on the basis of (1) month 
equaling one hundred forty five (145) hours. 
Effective September 1, 2002, a Short-Hour, Temporary and Per diem 
Nurse whose status is changed to Regular shall have her/his"
"28 seniority earned as a Short-Hour, Temporary and Per diem Nurse","credited to Regular status on the basis of eighty-seven (87) hours 
worked after September 1, 2002 equaling one (1) month's service. 
No Nurse shall accumulate more than one (1) month's service in 
any one (1) calendar month. Seniority credit for hours worked prior 
to September 1, 2002 shall be credited on the basis of one (1) 
month equaling one hundred forty five (145) hours. 
803 Implementation of the new seniority system shall occur on June 1, 1978, 
retroactive to January 1, 1978, subject to the following provisions: 
All Regular Nurses on the payroll as of January 1, 1978, shall receive 
prior seniority credit as a Regular Nurse back to the date of hire. 
All Short-Hour, Temporary and Per diem Nurses on the payroll 
as of January 1, 1978, shall receive prior seniority credit as a Short-
Hour, Temporary and Per diem Nurse at the rate of eighty (80) 
hours seniority credit for every calendar month back to the date of 
hire. 
804 Effective September 1, 2002, such hours of seniority credit shall then be 
added to the number of hours of seniority credit accumulated after January 
1, 1978 pursuant to paragraph 802. The total number of hours shall then be 
divided by one hundred forty five (145) for all hours worked before 
September 1, 2002 in order to determine Registered Nurses' total months 
of seniority credit for all hours worked before September 1, 2002. For 
hours worked after September 1, 2002, the total number of hours to 
determine seniority credit shall be divided by eighty seven (87) to 
determine the total months of seniority credit accumulated after 
September 1, 2002. 
805 Bargaining unit seniority as defined above shall apply within the department, 
facility and bargaining unit respectively for all Nurses as follows: 
Department 
806 A department is defined as a unit such as Pediatrics, OB, ICU, ER, 
Dermatology, OR, etc. Each entity shall establish the department 
applicable to its particular operations. A clinic which has been identified by 
the Employer as a Functional Unit shall be considered a single department. 
Facility 
807 A facility is defined as a medical center and its associated Medical Office 
Buildings and satellite clinics, such as Oakland, Richmond, Hayward, etc., 
or a Call Center."
29 Bargaining Unit,808 The bargaining unit is defined as all Nurses covered by this Agreement.
B – Availability For Extra Shifts,"809 Registered Nurses who wish to work additional shifts beyond their regular 
schedules may express their availability in accordance with each facility’s 
Availability Policy. Availability for the purposes of this document means 
that any Nurse expressing availability for any shifts agrees to work if 
scheduled. Such availability for a scheduled shift shall remain in place 
unless modified or withdrawn by the Nurse pursuant to facility policy prior 
to seventy-two (72) hours before the commencement of the shift. 
810 Nurses who have made themselves available shall be selected to work extra 
shifts based upon scheduling needs and seniority in accordance with 
the following priority: 
First to employees available on a straight time basis in the following order: 
Employees in the same department and shift; 
Employees in the same department, other shifts;  
Float Department employees, same shift; 
Float Department employees, other shifts;  
Other employees from the facility; 
Employees from another Kaiser facility. 
Second to employees available to work on an overtime basis by seniority 
in the same order as above, but in the following sequence according to the 
least amount of overtime pay: 
Employees available to work at time and one-half (including daily or 
weekly overtime, 6th consecutive day in a payroll week, eighth 
(or more) consecutive day). 
Employees available to work at double time (including double shifts, 
hours in excess of 12, seventh day in a work week). 
Prior to offering third weekend penalty pay, the facility may offer extra 
shifts to Nurses who have not indicated formal availability. Registry 
and travelers may be offered extra shifts only after the above 
process has been followed and has not been successful in assigning 
the extra work. 
Finally to employees available to work for third weekend penalty pay, by 
seniority in the same order as above."
,"810, the Employer may give first priority to employees who will not work 
overtime, as defined in"
"708 and 709 of the CBA, at any time during","the workweek that includes the extra shift.  Employees who would work 
overtime at any time during the workweek that includes the extra shift may 
be given second priority.  The rules set forth in"
810 will determine,"the priority order as between employees within either of these groups. 
(Appendix P -  Extra Shifts 2014-2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement).     
812 Nurses who have made themselves available shall be able to exercise 
their seniority up to 72 hours prior to the beginning of the shift. As of 
seventy-two (72) hours prior to the shift, Nurses selected in accordance with 
the above priority shall be confirmed to work. Previously scheduled but 
less senior Nurses who are displaced under this provision shall be so 
notified by the Employer immediately upon displacement. Nurses 
confirmed to work at seventy-two (72) hours shall be expected to report to 
work as scheduled. 
813 A Nurse who removes his or her availability at time of confirmation shall be 
relisted for availability purposes in the least senior position, unless such 
Nurse resubmits availability for the desired shift to the staffing office in 
accordance with facility policy. 
814 Nurses who are not confirmed at seventy-two (72) hours shall remain 
on the availability list until the shift commences, but such Nurses shall 
not have any displacement rights over junior Nurses that have been 
previously confirmed. Selection of any employees to work after the 
seventy-two (72) hour period shall continue to be as provided for in 
paragraph 810, above."
C – Breaking A Seniority Tie,"815 If two (2) Nurses have the same seniority date, the following method 
shall be implemented for breaking any seniority ties: 
First, by using the last four (4) digits of the Registered Nurse’s California 
Registered Nurse License number, with the lower number being 
considered the more senior Nurse; and, if this is not resolved, 
Second, by using the full California Registered Nurse license number, 
with the lower license number being considered the more senior Nurse."
D – Layoff and Recall,"816 A layoff, as referred to above in"
"A – Seniority, Accumulation and","Application, is defined as an involuntary change to unpaid status of more 
than fourteen (14) consecutive days. A cancellation involves any reduction"
31 of a day or less of work. A short term reduction in force involves any,"reduction of more than one but less than 14 days. 
Reduction in Force of Less than Fourteen (14) Days 
817 For short term reductions in force, scheduled hours will be reduced or 
canceled in the following order in the affected department: 
Registry personnel. 
Volunteers to reduce or cancel hours. 
Nurses with the least bargaining unit seniority (inverse seniority) 
in the following group: Per diem and Temporary, Regular and Short-
Hour working beyond regular schedule (extra hours or days) in that 
payroll week. 
Nurses with the least bargaining unit seniority (inverse seniority) 
in the following group: Regular and Short-Hour working regular 
scheduled hours. 
818 Nurses who are involuntarily reduced shall be offered work within her/his 
facility that is being performed by Registered Nurse registry personnel 
provided such Nurse is qualified to perform the work. 
819 Nurses who volunteer or are involuntarily reduced shall have the option (if 
applicable) to take earned vacation, a holiday, compensatory time, or unpaid 
leave of absence. 
Layoffs 
820  In the event of a layoff, on the request of the Association or the Employer, 
the Parties shall investigate the feasibility of a work-share arrangement 
among Nurses, and may, by mutual agreement, institute such a work-share 
arrangement. If no agreement is reached on a work-share arrangement, 
Nurses who are laid off shall have seniority among themselves and shall 
be given first preference for position vacancies in the Northern California 
Region provided that the Nurse is qualified to fill the vacancy. [See 
paragraph 4027 for effects of disciplinary actions on transfer requests.] 
821 In the event the Employer implements a layoff of sixty (60) days or 
more, the Employer will notify and meet with the Association at their 
request prior to layoff to discuss the layoff and retention procedures 
specific to that situation.  In any such layoff, the Employer will retain 
Patient Care Coordinator Case Managers based on their department 
seniority within the facility.  Work will be reassigned by the Employer 
provided the Patient Care Coordinator Case Manager is qualified to"
"32 perform such work.  In the event of a layoff, The Employer is under no","obligation to reassign,  orient, train, or  cross-train a Staff  Nurse  I-IV, 
Home Health Nurse I-II, or Nurse Practitioner I-III to work as a Patient 
Care Coordinator Case Manager.
822 Laid off Nurses shall retain seniority and preference rights for: Twelve (12) 
months; or 
Until the Nurse has been placed in a permanent position of like 
status, classification and pay held prior to layoffs, or has opted to 
accept a position in a different status, classification, and/or pay; or 
Until the Nurse has refused recall to a position of like status, 
classification and pay held prior to layoff within the facility, whichever 
occurs first. 
While on layoff, the Nurse may elect per diem status without 
affecting her/his preference rights under this provision. 
Preference Rights 
823 Whenever a Nurse is laid off, prior to the actual last day of work of such 
Nurse, the Employer will request that the Nurse submit a transfer request 
form for each facility (hospital or medical office) at which the Nurse would 
like to be considered for potential vacancies, should they become 
available after the Nurse is laid off. Laid off nurses shall be assisted in 
accessing Kaiser Permanente’s available internally posted 
position(s), upon request, for a period of twelve (12) months after the 
layoff date. 
824 Nurses shall be recalled in the inverse order of layoff."
E – Extended Layoffs,"825 In the event the Employer implements a layoff of sixty (60) days or 
more, the Employer will notify and meet with the Association to discuss 
layoff and retention procedures specific to that situation. In any such layoff 
the Employer will retain Nurses based on their bargaining unit seniority 
within their assigned entity (hospital or clinic) and reassign the work 
provided the Nurse is qualified to perform such work. 
826 It is agreed that the reassignment selection process in the affected units 
will be based on seniority and the ability to be oriented, cross-trained, or 
trained within a reasonable period (see below) to perform available work 
as referenced above."
"33 827 It is agreed that the definitions for orientation, cross-training, and training","are as follows: 
Orientation consists of up to five (5) days, depending on the 
competency of the individual, and the needs of the patient and 
unit. This generally represents moving between similar units. 
Cross-training consists of up to eighty (80) hours and generally 
represents cross-training to a more specialized (similar) unit, or for 
Nurses with previous experience in a more specialized area. 
Training consists of more than eighty (80) hours and no more than 
three months. The Parties agree that Nurses who require training 
shall only be reassigned to such units contingent on an expectation 
of success in such training within three (3) months or less. Nurses 
who require more than three (3) months training at the time of 
reassignment shall not be reassigned to such departments or units. 
Departments or units that meet these criteria include, but are not 
limited to, Critical Care, Labor and Delivery, Emergency, Oncology, 
GI Procedures, Surgical Services and Mental Health. The Parties 
shall determine if additional departments or units at a hospital or 
outpatient clinic where a layoff is to occur meet these criteria and 
should be subject to the same restrictions. The Employer may, but is 
not required to, provide additional training in order to enable a Nurse 
to be eligible for an assignment that requires training under this 
paragraph. 
828 The Parties agree that the Employer will provide an evaluation forty-five (45) 
days after completion of orientation, cross training, and/or training to 
assess the employee's competence. 
The Employer agrees to provide regular performance feedback to the Nurse 
during the training period. 
If during the training period management determines that a Nurse is not 
successfully progressing through the training period, and concludes that 
additional training will not be successful, or at the conclusion of the 
training period the Employer determines that a Nurse failed to meet 
the objectives of the training/orientation program required for the new 
position, the Nurse will be assessed for competence to perform the job. The 
Employer has the right to lay off such Nurse without regard to bargaining 
unit seniority, provided there are no open positions for which the RN is 
qualified. The Employer will meet with the Union to identify all reasonable 
alternative placement options and make a good faith effort to agree on 
such placement prior to laying off the Nurse. Nothing herein shall 
preclude the Association from filing a grievance on behalf of the affected 
Nurse."
34 829 Recall of an employee who is laid off shall be in accordance with Article,"VIII, paragraphs 820-824."
F – Non-Registered Nurse Experience,"830 Newly classified Registered Nurses who have had previous experience 
with the Employer in a Kaiser Permanente facility covered by this 
Collective Bargaining Agreement in a nursing classification shall be given 
prorated seniority credit on the basis of one (1) year's seniority for every 
three (3) years of continuous service with the Employer in such a nursing 
classification. The nursing classifications that are eligible for credit are: 
LVN, CNA, Nursing Assistant (or Care Partner), certified personnel such 
as Respiratory Techs and X-Ray Techs, and other classifications or 
individuals whose experience is relevant and mutually agreed upon by the 
Parties. 
900 ARTICLE IX – POSITION POSTING AND FILLING OF VACANCIES"
A – Posting,"901 Registered Nurse positions under this Agreement which are permanently 
vacated or newly created in a given entity shall be posted on the bulletin 
board for one (1) day within the department in which they occur. Nurses 
within the department shall be given preference in filling such position on 
a seniority basis. If the position is not filled from within the department in 
accordance with the foregoing, the vacancy shall be posted on bulletin 
boards for five (5) days in the facility where it occurs, and shall be 
simultaneously posted on Kaiser Permanente’s internet job site. The 
Employer’s obligation to post on bulletin boards for 5 days in the 
facility expires at the of the 2017-2022 contract.  
902 Written requests for a change in shift or scheduled hours within the same 
classification and department shall be considered an automatic/ open  bid for 
shift change or scheduled hours for ninety (90) days following submission 
of such request to her or his manager. Automatic/ open  bids under this 
provision shall only be applicable to one (1) day department postings 
within the RN/NP’s department, and shall be subject to the limits on 
applications set forth in paragraph 913. 
903 Applicants who successfully bid on a posted position shall be transferred 
to the new position as soon as reasonably possible subject to operational 
requirements. Under no circumstances shall the transfer be delayed more 
than one (1) month from the time the position is awarded unless by mutual 
agreement between the Parties. 
904 For the purposes of this"
"only, a Short-Hour, Temporary and Per",diem Nurse shall fulfill the requirement of six (6) months in a department
35 upon completion of five hundred twenty (520) hours of work in that,"department. 
905 All Short-Hour, Temporary, Per diem Nurses, or Nurses assigned to a float 
pool department position who begin work in a given department shall 
become eligible for bidding on vacancies within that Department after 
completion of five hundred twenty (520) hours therein. The Nurses 
referenced above who fulfill the five hundred twenty (520) hour 
requirement within one department shall retain seniority rights in that 
department as well as the float department. Nurses shall forfeit those 
seniority rights in any such department where no work is performed 
within a calendar year. The intention of this"
is solely to establish,"twenty-four (24) hour bidding rights for all Nurses whose exclusive 
assignment is to float. 
906 If the Employer determines that specialty training positions (including 
but not limited to OR, ED, L&D, ICU, WOC, etc.) are required due to 
vacancies and/or lack of fully-qualified RNs, such positions will be posted 
as Staff Nurse positions in accordance with paragraph 901 and filled in 
accordance with paragraphs 908 and 909. Such postings will include the 
permanent shift assignment and schedule for the position, and the actual 
training schedule which may be different. RNs who already meet the 
standard minimum requirements for the positions shall not have to 
complete the training course. Successful applicants for the training 
positions shall be transferred in time for commencement of the training 
program."
B – Special Notification to Absent Nurses,"907 For Nurses on vacation or leave of absence who have requested such in 
writing, notices of vacancies shall be sent to an address indicated by the 
Nurse. A Nurse who is on leave of absence in excess of thirty (30) days and 
is granted the position must be available to return to work within at least 
fourteen (14) days from the date of the posting of the position if required by 
the facility."
C – Preference in Filling Vacancies,"908 Nurses employed by the Employer may apply for such permanent 
vacancy or newly created position and shall be given preference in filling 
such vacancy on a seniority basis provided the Nurse is qualified to fill the 
vacant position. A Nurse may determine the status of her/his transfer 
request or outcome of a posted position by logging onto the Kaiser 
Permanente internet job site or contacting the local Human Resources 
Staffing/Recruitment Office. [See paragraph 4027 for effects of disciplinary 
actions on transfer requests.]"
36 909 The order for awarding bids is first to the one day departmental posting and,"second to the facility wide (KFH and TPMG) five (5) day posting. 
Vacancies remaining unfilled following the five (5) day facility posting shall 
be filled from among qualified internal applicants, if any, on a seniority basis 
regionally before outside applicants are considered. It is understood that 
for the purposes of expediency the five (5) day facility posting and the 
regional five day posting shall be administered simultaneously. 
910 For purposes of the five (5) day facility bids, the following groupings shall 
apply. 
For the Multi-site and Multi-Medical Center premiums, in accordance with 
paragraph 2345, compensation for the Multi-site agreement is a 2% 
differential paid when working in multiple lettered locations. 
Compensation for the Multi- Medical Center agreement is a 5% 
differential paid when working in multiple numbered locations.

D – Other Sources,"911 If during the five (5) days posting period there is no application for the 
permanent vacancy or newly created position by any Registered Nurses 
employed by the Employer, the facility may fill the position from any 
source."
E – Temporary Filling of Vacancies,"912 The above does not prevent the Employer from filling the vacancy on a 
temporary basis for a temporary period up to a maximum of ninety (90) 
days unless such temporary period is extended by mutual consent. The 
Association agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold consent to 
extending the temporary period."
F – Limits on Applications/Six Month Bar,"913 A Registered Nurse employed by the Employer who applies for and is 
awarded a posted position may not apply for another vacancy, except for 
a change in shift or scheduled hours within the same classification and 
department, before six (6) months unless there is mutual agreement 
among the Employer, the Nurse, and the Association. If no other Nurses 
apply for such later vacancy within its five (5) day posting period and the 
Employer would otherwise have to go outside to hire, the six (6) month 
bar provided for in this"
shall be waived. Nurses who would have,"otherwise been prohibited from bidding upon the vacant position due to 
the six (6) month bar, and who are otherwise qualified in accordance 
with"
"C – Preference in Filling Vacancies above, will then be","considered for the position, provided they submitted a bid for the position 
during the five (5) day posting period."
G – Registered Nurse Interviews,"914 When employees of Kaiser Permanente obtain their Registered Nurse 
license, apply for and meet the posted requirements of a Registered 
Nurse position covered by this Agreement, they will be interviewed. 
915 Registered Nurses currently employed at Kaiser Permanente, upon 
obtaining their masters degree in nursing and NP certification, will be 
eligible for an informational interview with the Nurse Executive and/or 
DONP to explore career opportunities. The Employer will advocate for and 
make its best effort to assist the NP to identify job opportunities that take"
"39 into consideration the NP’s past nursing experience, educational","preparation and clinical rotations. 
916 This procedure shall not constitute a commitment to hire the employee 
and the employee shall not have recourse through the grievance procedure 
of this contract should they be declined for employment as a Registered 
Nurse/Nurse Practitioner. 
917 Once a month each facility will notify the Association of any vacancies in 
Nurses' positions subject to this Agreement which have not been filled 
through the posting provisions of Article IX – Position Posting and Filling of 
Vacancies, and which have remained vacant thereafter. 
1000 ARTICLE X – REGISTERED NURSE VACANCIES AND REPLACEMENTS"
A – Overutilization,"1001 If a Nurse works a consistent amount of additional hours/shifts each week 
for a period in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days, not including time 
specifically identified for vacation and/or education leave replacement, and 
it is reasonable to expect the work to continue, the Association shall have 
the right to require the Employer to post and fill the position, with 
adequate notice, in accordance with Article IX."
B – Vacancies Not Filled,"1002 If a Registered Nurse position under this Agreement becomes permanently 
vacant and is not filled, the Association may request discussion of the 
vacancy with the facility. If the Parties cannot agree, the issue shall be 
submitted to the grievance procedure. If the issue goes to an arbitrator, 
s(he) shall not have jurisdiction to order the vacancy filled if the vacancy 
has been caused by a curtailment at the facility which affects nursing 
service. Nor shall s(he) have jurisdiction to order the vacancy filled unless 
other causes advanced by the facility prove to be unjustifiable."
C – Vacancies Filled by Non-Registered Nurse,"1003 If a Registered Nurse under this Agreement is permanently replaced by

technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of care provided to its 
patients and that the overriding principle governing the introduction of 
such technologies shall be the provision of the highest levels of patient 
care in terms of the patients’ health and safety. The Parties agree that 
such technologies shall not be used to replace Registered Nurses in the 
delivery of patient care, nor to interfere with the exercise of Registered 
Nurses’ clinical judgment, nor to undermine their ability to perform their 
professional responsibilities, nor to inhibit their ability to provide safe 
therapeutic and effective care, nor to require them to practice in any 
manner that places their professional nursing license in jeopardy. The 
Employer agrees to notify the Association prior to implementing new 
information technologies that affect the practice of Registered Nurses, and

designated by the Employer to provide clinical experience and guidance to 
Nurse Practitioner students during the course of their educational program. 
Specific functions of the NP preceptor will be coordinated between the 
preceptor, students and the students’ NP program clinical supervisor. The 
Employer will encourage Nurse Practitioners to volunteer as preceptors, 
and will not unreasonably deny the request of a Nurse Practitioner to 
precept a NP student."
B – Nurse Practitioner Mentoring Program,"2003 The intent of a Nurse Practitioner Mentoring Program is to make the newly 
hired Nurse Practitioner sufficiently familiar with the Kaiser system and to 
have achieved a level of competency in the new role. The expectation at the 
end of the mentoring period is that s/he is able to fully function as a member 
of the health care team. When no NP II or NP III is available to mentor, a 
physician or other appropriate clinician mentor shall be designated. 
2004 The Nurse Practitioner mentor will be responsible for mentoring a new 
Nurse Practitioner. However, other Nurse Practitioners may assume 
responsibility for a newly hired Nurse Practitioner in the absence of the 
mentor or to provide for additional mentoring needs. 
2005 When a NP moves to a new clinical specialty area, they shall be formally 
mentored in the new area, to ensure clinical competency. 
2006 A Nurse Practitioner designated as a mentor in a formal Nurse Practitioner 
Mentoring Program shall receive additional compensation of $1.50 per hour 
above the NP’s hourly wage rate for each hour that the NP is assigned 
to perform mentoring duties and responsibilities as defined in the regional 
“best practice” or model Nurse Practitioner mentoring program. 
2100 ARTICLE XXI – CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION 
The rights of patients to receive necessary nursing care and the obligation 
of the facility to render such care must be recognized and respected. In 
the case of therapeutic abortions, the nursing profession accepts the 
obligation of providing competent nursing care as a major responsibility; 
however, it is recognized that a Registered Nurse may hold sincere moral 
or religious beliefs which require the Nurse in good conscience to refuse 
participation in such procedure. 
2102 The facility agrees that a Nurse may, except in an emergency situation 
where the patient's needs will not allow for personnel substitution, refuse 
to participate in therapeutic abortion procedures and will not be subject 
to coercion, censure, unreasonable transfer, unreasonable reassignment 
or discipline by reason of such refusal. A Registered Nurse who has an 
assignment where participation in therapeutic abortion routinely occurs 
and who conscientiously objects to such participation, shall notify the 
Director of Nursing Service of this position in writing and must decide 
whether or not to request transfer to another assignment. 
In emergency situations where the immediate nature of the patient's needs 
will not allow for substitution, the patient's right to receive the necessary 
nursing care shall take precedence over the exercise of the Nurse's"
"78 individual beliefs and rights. In such cases, the facility shall arrange for","substitution at the earliest possible opportunity. 
2200 ARTICLE XXII – PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS 
2201 Before employment, each Nurse shall be given without charge a physical 
examination by a licensed provider of the Employer's staff or her/his 
designee. 
2202 An annual physical examination shall be provided by the Employer at the 
option of the Nurse. Such examination shall be conducted during the Nurse's 
non-working hours. The examining licensed provider may utilize diagnostic 
tests as deemed appropriate. Certification that the Nurse is free of 
communicable disease and physically able to perform work assigned will 
be provided in conjunction with the examination. 
2300 ARTICLE XXIII – COMPENSATION"

minimum of $400 per month promotional increase, whichever is greater."
"80 Short-Hour, Temporary and Per diem Nurses - Daily Rate","2317 All Short-Hour, Temporary and Per diem Nurses shall be paid a rate that 
includes a twenty-five percent (25%) premium over the appropriate

classifications under the jurisdiction of the California Nurses Association 
including the classifications of Staff Nurse I, II, III, IV; Charge Nurse I, II, 
III, IV; Nurse Practitioner I, II, III; and Home Health Nurse I, II, III."
B – Credit for Previous Experience Tenure Credit,"2318 Newly employed Registered Nurses, Home Health Nurses and Nurse 
Practitioners shall receive one (1) year tenure credit for salary purposes 
only for every two (2) years of previous experience within their respective 
classification within the last ten (10) years prior to the date of employment. 
For the purpose of this"
", any previous part-time experience which","has been on a basis of twenty (20) hours per week or more shall be 
considered as if it were full-time experience. 
Automatic Tenure Credit 
2319 Newly hired employees who are qualified and competent to perform to the 
Employer’s position requirements shall receive automatic tenure credit 
pursuant to the above paragraph for experience previously acquired as a 
Registered Nurse, Home Health Nurse, or Nurse Practitioner. Newly hired 
Nurses with experience in foreign medical facilities who meet the above 
requirements shall qualify for tenure credit provided that all such experience 
is directly applicable and can be verified to the Employer’s satisfaction. 
Only prior experience that can be verified under these circumstances shall 
be considered for tenure credit purposes. 
Previous Experience With Kaiser 
2320 Former employees who are hired back into the same classification held at 
the time of termination are treated as follows: 
Former employees who have had at least six months of previous 
service and are hired back within six months from the date of 
termination are placed at the step rate held at the date of 
termination and receive credit for prior service in determining the 
date of the next step rate increase. 
Former employees who have had at least six months of previous 
service and are hired back after six months, but less than one year 
from the date of termination may, at the discretion of the head of 
the facility, receive credit for  prior service in  determining  the  new"
81 starting rate. Under no circumstance will they receive less than the,"amount due under paragraph 2318 and 2319 above. 
The reinstatement of service credit relates to the establishment 
of the appropriate step rate level to apply to an employee who is 
hired back into a Regular position. 
With respect to bargaining unit seniority the employee who is hired 
back is considered to be a new employee. 
Other Experience 
2321 Tenure credit for previous employment which does not fully conform to the 
above definition of previous experience shall be discussed at the request 
of the Association on a facility by facility basis."
C – Tenure Increases,"Regular Nurses

compensatory time off equal to one-half (1/2) of the time they were 
on such “standby duty” or shall be compensated for such time at 
one-half (1/2) times their straight-time hourly rate including shift 
differential. The determination of whether shift differential is due 
or not due shall be based on the qualifications dealing with 
eligibility for shift differential as reflected in"
D – Differentials,"of this Article in relation to the standby hours assigned. 
2350 Standby periods shall be divided into eight (8) hour periods and 
fractions thereof and provisions pertaining herein to the three (3) hour

three (3) hours work for each occasion on which they are called in. 
However, the total hours of work paid at time and one-half (1 1/2) 
shall not exceed the number of hours in the standby period assigned 
to the Nurse and, further, the number of hours credited to the 
Nurse at time and one-half (1 1/2) shall be deducted from the"
86 number of hours the Nurse has been on standby to determine the,"number of hours, if any, to be paid at one-half (1/2) time. 
Not on Standby 
2353 A Regular full-time Nurse who has completed a shift and leaves the 
facility but is recalled to work prior to the start of the Nurse's next 
scheduled shift shall be guaranteed a minimum of three (3) hours of 
work or pay at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2).

work of an indefinite duration but shall not be work performed 
continuous with the Nurse's daily work schedule unless the Nurse 
had been previously scheduled to commence a standby period 
at the conclusion of his/her regular shift. 
2355 The intent of standby is to provide coverage when it is impractical to regularly 
staff a shift, or when it is necessary to supplement core staffing to meet 
unpredictable emergency patient care needs. It is not the intent of the 
Employer to use standby assignments as a substitute for adequate core 
staffing."
F – Relief in Higher Classifications,"2356 Registered Nurses who relieve in higher classifications shall receive

months. 
2510 The Employer's provision of insurance benefits to domestic partners and 
their eligible dependents will be in accordance with applicable federal and 
state laws, withholding tax requirements and Internal Revenue Service 
requirements."
A – Eligibility,"Accumulation 
2601 Each Regular full-time Nurse shall accumulate sick leave at the rate of one 
(1) day (eight (8) hours) for each month of employment. Effective after the 
completion of the fourth year of employment each Regular Nurse shall 
accumulate sick leave at the rate of one and one-fourth days (ten (10) 
hours) sick leave with pay for each calendar month of employment.  
Each Regular part-time Nurse shall accumulate sick leave at the 
prorated rate pursuant to paragraph 2401.   
Waiting Period 
2602 A Nurse is not entitled to any paid sick leave during the first ninety (90) 
days of continuous employment; thereafter, credit on the above basis is 
granted from the first day of employment."

shall also apply for hours directly associated with medical, dental or 
mental health appointments. For those Nurses whose appointments are 
away from the facility where they work, the appointment shall be

first or last hour of each paid period of scheduled work. The Nurse 
shall give written notice of at least twenty-four (24) hours and supply 
verification that the appointment was kept."
C – Proof of Disability,"2605 If an employee claims sick leave, the Employer may require reasonable 
proof of disability sufficient to justify the employee’s absence from work

off for individuals who demonstrate a pattern of inappropriate use of sick 
leave. Sick leave during which pay is received shall not be determined an 
interruption of a Nurse’s continuous service date. 
2606 The employer shall not make blanket requests for Verification of 
Treatments (VOTs). Such requests may be made of those individual"
90 employees who demonstrate a pattern of suspicious use of sick time. It is,"not the intent of the parties that a nurse will be disciplined for using sick 
leave due to an accident or illness, where there is no pattern of suspicious 
use or history of attendance problems. Accordingly, nurses will not be 
disciplined because they have taken time off, including legitimate sick time, 
that is protected by federal or applicable state or local laws."
D – Integration of UCD Benefits,"2607 Sick leave pay subject to integration with Unemployment Compensation 
Disability (UCD) and Workers' Compensation (WC) shall be paid promptly

(UCD) benefits, Employer-paid sick leave shall be reduced by the amount 
of the UCD benefits the Nurse is eligible to receive. Payments received

accumulated sick leave. If a Nurse is eligible for Workers' Compensation  
insurance payments, the same method of integration with Employer-paid 
sick leave shall apply.

Unemployment Compensation Disability program shall not be assigned 
by the Nurse to Kaiser Foundation Hospital."

vacation of one or more weeks. The employer shall require reasonable 
proof of the disabling illness or injury, obtained at the time of the disabling 
event."
F – Sick Leave Account,"2612 At the Nurse's request the Employer shall provide the Nurse with a written 
account of the sick leave the Nurse has accumulated together with a

of continuous service; three (3) calendar weeks’ vacation with pay annually 
during the 2nd–4th years of continuous service; four (4) calendar weeks’ 
vacation with pay annually during the 5th–9th years of continuous 
service; and five (5) calendar weeks’ vacation with pay annually during 
the 10th year of continuous service and thereafter. 
2702 Each Regular Nurse who has completed six (6) months of continuous 
employment shall be entitled to any vacation pay accrued during that period 
of time. Such paid vacation shall be charged against the Nurse’s vacation 
accrual for the Nurse’s first twelve (12) months of continuous service."
B – CNA Vacation Option,"2703 Each Nurse who is eligible for 2 weeks or more vacation may, at the Nurse’s 
option, elect to take an extra week of vacation without pay. No more than 
1 extra week of vacation may be received in this manner. To implement this 
provision, each Nurse who wishes to exercise this option shall, at any 
time prior to the completion of her/his year of employment, notify the 
facility in writing. The option shall be effective during the anniversary 
year immediately following receipt of notification, and shall continue in 
effect until the Nurse notifies the Employer in writing of his or her desire to 
rescind the option. A Nurse exercising this option shall receive the extra 
weeks’ vacation. A Nurse may not change the option until the Nurse’s next 
anniversary year. Such vacation shall be granted in accordance with the 
vacation provisions of the contract. Entitlement is not dependent upon the 
prior exhaustion of other paid vacation."
C – Payments,"2704 Vacation pay shall be based on the Nurse's regular straight-time rate 
plus shift differential."
92 Vacation Eligibility,"2705 Vacations for Regular Nurses working a minimum of twenty (20) but less than 
forty (40) hours per week shall be paid proportionate to the average 
number of hours regularly worked, but not less than regularly scheduled 
per week during the vacation accrual year. However, they are entitled to 
time off in full week increments pursuant to paragraph 2708, unless 
otherwise requested. 
2706 Each Short Hour Nurse shall receive scheduled vacation time off without 
pay based upon their years of service, in direct proportion to the entitlement 
of Regular Nurses. 
2707 In the event a Nurse is called back to work from vacation, such Nurse shall 
be paid at time and one-half for any vacation days worked and a 
replacement vacation day with pay will be scheduled at a future date. 
In instances where there is a combination of vacation and work on a 
pre-scheduled basis, vacation hours paid shall count as hours worked in 
determining eligibility for weekly overtime."
D – Scheduling of Vacation,"Vacation Scheduling 
2708 Unit/departmental vacation schedules shall be developed with sufficient full 
week vacation opportunity to cover all vacation liability, including the 
CNA Vacation Option described in"
B above to be utilized by,"employees as time off within the vacation year. 
2709 Pre-scheduled vacation requests shall not be automatically denied based 
upon rules associated with limits as to the number of employees taking 
vacation in any one week. Before denying a request, the Employer shall 
make all reasonable attempts to accommodate conflicts considering the 
utilization of its availability policy, pre-scheduling of per-diem and short 
hour employees, shift trades in support of vacation scheduling and the 
employment of registry/travelers. 
2710 Staffing shall meet with employees on an individual and/or unit/departmental 
basis before schedules are finalized in order to explore all reasonable 
options for resolving such conflicts. 
2711 Similar consideration shall be given to non-prescheduled vacation 
requests, provided that such requests are submitted at least thirty (30) 
calendar days prior to the time to be taken. Regarding non-prescheduled 
requests made less than thirty (30) days in advance, good faith efforts shall 
be made to accommodate such requests, but in no event will the Employer"
93 incur any incremental costs in making such accommodations. With regard,"to non-prescheduled vacation requests, operational needs of the unit shall 
be considered in making such determinations. 
Selection Procedure 
2712 By January 1 the Employer will post, for each department, a seniority list 
and a vacation calendar for the period beginning April 1 of that year, 
through March 31 of the next year. Nurses will enter their vacation 
preference by January 31st of each year on the posted calendar. The 
facility shall post a schedule of vacations by March 15th of each year. 
Schedule Preference 
2713 If staffing and patient care requirements do not permit all Nurses 
requesting a certain vacation preference to take their vacations over the 
same time period, length of service in the bargaining unit shall be the 
determining factor within each unit. 
Vacation Segments 
2714 Nurses may split their vacation into increments of not less than one (1) day, 
subject to the requirements of efficient operations. 
No Seasonal Ban 
2715 A request for vacation shall not unreasonably be denied because of the 
season of the year. 
Deferred Vacation 
2716 It is the intention of the Parties to this Agreement that the vacation time to 
which a Nurse is entitled shall be taken each year. A Nurse may, because 
of a disability which may necessitate a postponement of the vacation or 
because of an approved leave of absence, or through mutual written 
agreement with the facility, defer earned vacation beyond the year during 
which the vacation would otherwise be taken. Earned vacation shall not 
be lost by reason of the provisions of this paragraph. Regular Nurses 
with five (5) or more years of continuous service may carry over one (1) 
week of unused vacation to their next anniversary year provided that they 
notify their supervisor in writing of their intention at least thirty (30) days 
prior to the completion of the anniversary year in which the one (1) weeks’ 
vacation would normally be taken."
E – Prorated Vacation Pay at Termination,"2717 Any Nurse who is eligible for vacations under the terms of this Agreement 
and whose service has been terminated after 6 months of service shall be 
entitled to terminal vacation with pay prorated on the basis of actual months 
of service."
F – Part-time Nurses Credit,"2718 Regular part-time Nurses' vacation pay shall be the base rate including 
shift differential at the time the vacation is taken, times the average number 
of straight- time hours worked per week during the vacation accrual year. 
If such pay for a Regular part-time Nurse exceeds the Nurses' regular 
schedule, the excess shall be attributed to weeks of earned vacation and 
shall be paid on days not normally scheduled."
G – Vacation Buy Back,"2719 Nurses eligible for at least four (4) weeks’ vacation per year may during 
each anniversary year choose to receive pay in lieu of one (1) or two 
(2) weeks of vacation, provided the Employer has an operational need to 
assign such Nurse. Acceptance of such in lieu pay shall be at the 
discretion of the Nurse, but such acceptance shall require the Nurse to 
work for the in lieu period, rather than taking the time off in either paid or 
unpaid status.  Sick leave shall not be applicable for the in lieu work period. 
2800 ARTICLE XXVIII – HOLIDAYS"
A – Recognized Holidays,"Regular Holidays

assigned alternative work for the day in the same or another department. 
Float and Birthday Holidays 
Floating Holiday 
2804 Each Nurse with 90 days of employment shall become eligible for one (1)

probationary employee shall be paid at the overtime rate of one and 
one-half (1 1/2) times regular pay for holidays worked."
D – Holiday Pay Practices,"Full-time Regular Nurses 
2811 A full-time Regular Nurse who works on a recognized holiday shall, in

2812 If a holiday falls on a full-time Regular Nurse's normal day off, the Nurse 
will be granted a work day off with pay within thirty (30) days of the holiday 
or an additional day's pay. 
2813 A full-time Regular Nurse who works on a paid holiday may have the 
option to waive the holiday pay to which the Nurse is entitled (not the time 
and one-half (1 1/2) for hours worked on the holiday), and instead of 
holiday pay take compensatory time off without loss of salary at a later 
date. The date upon which the Nurse takes the compensatory time off 
shall be set only by mutual agreement between the Nurse and the facility 
involved. If such mutual agreement on a date cannot be reached, the 
Nurse shall take such compensatory time off without loss of salary as an 
addition to the Nurse's next vacation or as payment upon termination, 
whichever comes first. 
2814 Holidays paid for but not worked shall count as time worked for the 
purpose of computing weekly overtime if the holiday falls on the Nurse's 
normally scheduled work day."
97 Part-time Regular Nurses,"2815 Part-time Regular Nurses working a minimum of twenty (20) but less than 
forty (40) hours per week shall be paid for holidays as follows: 
If the holiday falls on a normally scheduled work day and the

time rate as the employee would have received had (s)he worked. 
For Nurses assigned to Alternative Shifts outlined in Article VII,"
"E, paragraph 720 and 721, holiday hours not worked shall","be paid 8 hours holiday pay for holiday not worked.   
If the holiday falls on a day normally scheduled off, the employee

weekly scheduled hours of work.  
If a holiday other than Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year's Day 
falls on a day normally scheduled to work and the employee works

times their pay for all hours worked. For holidays where the Nurse 
receives two and one-half times (2½) their regular pay, 1½ times 
for hours worked and 1 times holiday pay, for all hours 
worked.  For example, if the Nurse works more than eight hours 
on the holiday, s/he will be paid two and one-half times for all hours 
worked. 
If Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year's Day falls on a day 
normally scheduled to work and the employee works such holiday,

Criteria 
2901 After completion of one (1) full year of service as a Regular Nurse, a 
Nurse will begin to earn paid educational leave at the rate of one (1) week 
per year accumulative to a maximum of four (4) weeks. The following 
shall serve as guidelines for the programs covered by paid educational 
leave: 
Formally organized courses in nursing; 
Formally organized courses in related subjects leading to a 
degree in nursing; 
Formally organized seminars and symposia dealing with the 
contemporary practices of nursing; 
Formally organized specialized courses relating to nursing practice; 
Formally organized clinical nursing seminars and institutes such 
as Maternity and Child Health and Medical/Surgical; 
Formally organized programs for health professionals open to 
Registered Nurses and which deal with issues involving patient care; 
Formally organized specialized programs not directly involving 
nursing but primarily related to patient's health and welfare (e.g. 
child development, counseling, home care, community health); 
Credited portions of courses and programs that have continuing 
education approval from the Board of Registered Nursing, provided 
the above guidelines are met."
99 Computer courses taken on campus provided the above guidelines,"are met. Such courses may not be repeated unless the individual 
has “failed” the course. 
2902 The various areas covered above shall include those sponsored by a 
hospital, educational institutions, government agencies or professional 
associations. 
2903 Requests for such leave shall be made in writing setting forth the details, i.e. 
dates, hours, subject, faculty and purpose for taking the course, seminar, 
etc. The Nurse may be requested by management to make a report on 
such activity in writing to the Director of Nursing. 
2904 Permission for such educational leave will not be unreasonably denied. The 
Employer and the Union mutually agree that pre-approval by management 
for education leave is not required on non-scheduled work time for BRN 
approved courses which offer continuing education units (CEUs) or 
continuing medical education (CMEs). Employees on any leave of absence 
will require management pre-approval of any education leave. 
2905 Educational leave shall be scheduled separately from vacations and shall 
not be used as a basis for denial of vacation requests for the same 
time off. When educational leave requests are made with less than 30 
days’ notice, operational needs of the unit shall be considered prior to the 
approval of such requests. 
2906 RNs/NPs shall not be denied paid education leave solely on course 
content, provided that nursing continuing education units (CEUs or CMEs) 
are being offered for the requested class. 
2907 In the event that more than one Nurse within a given Department 
requests the same Educational Leave day(s) off, and it is not feasible to 
grant all such requests, then the requests shall be honored in rotation on 
the basis of the bargaining unit seniority of Nurses within the Department, 
provided that the rotation shall commence anew each calendar year. 
2908 It is understood that an individual Nurse shall have a choice in the selection 
of the types of educational programs in which the Nurse shall participate. 
Method of Payment 
2909 A Nurse shall be paid for educational leave if the educational program 
occurs on a day that the Nurse is not scheduled to work, provided the 
educational program meets the other criteria established this"
.,"Such leave shall not count as time worked for the purpose of determining 
eligibility for overtime."
100 2910 If the educational program occurs on a day the Nurse is scheduled to,"work, the following principles shall govern: 
2911 If the educational program has a duration of four (4) or more hours within or 
without a shift in whole or in part, the Nurse will be excused from her/his 
shift and receive eight (8) hours educational leave pay for such day, or 
up to a maximum of the Nurse's regular schedule if less than eight (8) 
hours. 
2912 If the educational program has a duration of less than four (4) hours and falls 
within the Nurse's shift in whole or in part, the Nurse will be paid for hours 
spent at the educational program and will work the balance of her/his shift 
or at the option of the Employer, the Nurse can be excused from her/his 
entire shift and be paid eight (8) hours educational leave pay or up to a 
maximum of the Nurse's regular schedule if less than eight (8) hours. The 
facility shall notify the Nurse of the option it elects at the time it approves the 
leave request. In no case shall the combination of paid work time and paid 
educational leave exceed eight (8) hours per day, or the Nurse's regular 
schedule if less than eight (8) hours. 
2913 If the educational program has a duration of less than four (4) hours 
and falls entirely outside the Nurse's shift, the Nurse shall not receive 
educational leave pay. In view of the fact that Nurses assigned to the night 
shift of operations seldom, if ever, have educational programs available 
during their normal hours of work, an exception to this subsection will be as 
follows: 
A night shift Nurse who attends educational programs which would 
otherwise qualify under the educational leave and pay provisions 
but fall entirely outside of the Nurse's night shift, may accumulate 
such educational leave time until (s)he has accumulated the 
equivalent of a full shift. At that time equivalent paid time off at the 
mutual convenience of the facility and the Nurse will be arranged. 
If the approved educational program is four (4) hours or more in 
duration, the Employer will excuse the Nurse from the night shift 
either immediately preceding or immediately following the program. 
The night shift from which the Nurse shall be excused shall be 
determined by the Employer, and the deduction from accrued 
educational leave shall be equal to the Nurse's normally scheduled 
shift. 
Confirmation 
2914 If written application for a paid or unpaid educational leave is received at 
least six (6) weeks prior to the effective date of the leave, the Employer 
will give written confirmation of approval or disapproval no later than four"
101 (4) weeks prior to the commencement of the leave. If written application,"is received less than six (6) weeks prior to the commencement of the leave, 
the Employer will give such written confirmation within two (2) weeks of 
receipt of the application. 
Home Study 
2915 A Nurse who is entitled to educational leave may elect to utilize such leave 
on a day(s) the Nurse is not normally scheduled to work for the purpose of 
home study. See paragraph 2904. 
All home study must be approved prior to starting the course. The 
course announcement must accompany the request for approval. 
Nurses will receive payment for CEU hours upon presentation of 
proof of successful completion of courses. 
For calculation of time, one (1) CEU will be equal to one (1) 
hour of educational leave. 
Home study will not be used to calculate overtime hours. 
2916 Education Funding 
Effective January 1, 2015, Nurses working 20 or more hours per week 
may be reimbursed up to $2,300 per calendar year for tuition and 
continuing education credits. Of the overall total reimbursement, Nurses 
may submit up to five hundred dollars ($500) for education-related travel 
and lodging expenses.  Effective January 1, 2019, Nurses working 20 
or more hours per week may be reimbursed up to $2,500 per calendar 
year for tuition and continuing education credits.  Of the overall total 
reimbursement, Nurses may submit up to five hundred dollars ($500) 
for education-related travel and lodging expenses.   
3000 ARTICLE XXX – BEREAVEMENT LEAVE 
3001 When a death occurs in the immediate family of a Nurse, the Nurse shall be 
entitled to three (3) days leave of absence with pay for deaths in the 
area and two (2) additional days with pay for travel of 300 miles or more 
(each way) for a funeral or memorial service. Additional time off will not 
be unreasonably denied. A Nurse may use paid time off for such purposes. 
3002 Immediate family is defined as spouse, domestic partner, parent, step 
parent, parent-in-law, step parent-in-law, in loco parentis, child, step 
child, legal ward, foster child, adopted child, daughter, step daughter,

in-law, sister, step sister, sister in-law, step sister in-law, brother, step 
brother, brother in-law, step brother in-law, grandparent, step-grandparent,"
"102  grandchildren, step grandchildren, and relatives living in the same","household. 
3003 If an employee is on paid time off and a death occurs in the immediate 
family, the employee may convert the paid time off to bereavement leave. 
3004 The Employer will not unreasonably deny the employee time off to 
attend or arrange for the funeral or memorial service of a person who is 
close to them. The employee may take time off without pay or, at the 
employee’s request, use earned or accrued paid time off for such purposes. 
3005 The parties agree that this benefit will be used responsibly. 
3006 Pay for bereavement leave shall be at the employee’s regular straight-time 
rate of pay, including applicable shift premium/differential. 
3100 ARTICLE XXXI – PAY FOR JURY DUTY 
3101 Nurses who are required to report for jury service will be paid the 
difference between their regular straight-time pay and jury pay received. 
3102 A Nurse excused in time to work at the facility as provided above shall 
not be required to work in the facility to the extent that the combination of 
service on jury duty and hours worked in the facility exceed a normal eight 
(8) hour day. Night shift Nurses shall be excused from work on the night 
immediately preceding or immediately following service on jury duty. 
3103 In the event that the combination of service on jury duty and hours worked 
in the facility exceed a normal forty (40) hour workweek, the Employer will 
use its best efforts to grant a Regular Nurse the weekend off if such Nurse 
is scheduled to work the weekend. 
3200 ARTICLE XXXII – INSURANCE BENEFITS AND DEPENDENT CARE

dependents or to pay the premium required to the Alternate Medical 
Plan currently described as KP2RX. Effective January 1, 2017, the 
Employer agrees to provide the post-2016 PID 10 EU7 (hereinafter “The 
Post-2016 PID Plan”) or the Alternate Medical Plan currently described as"

absent mutual agreement of the parties to deviate from such benefit levels. 
It is understood by the parties that the term of the health plan contract 
between the insurer and the Employer may not be coextensive with the 
term of the collective bargaining agreement. Should the insurer seek to 
alter the benefits provided under the applicable Kaiser Foundation Health 
Plan benefit contract during the term of the collective bargaining agreement, 
the Employer shall pay an additional premium to the insurer to prevent 
such changes from impacting bargaining unit members (e.g., “buy up” 
the changes). Should this not be feasible due to constraints imposed by the 
insurer, the Employer shall provide notice and an opportunity to bargain 
over such changes to the Union. The Union and Employer shall bargain in 
good faith over such changes, and arrive at mutual agreement over

However, the Employer shall provide the Association with forty-five (45) 
days’ notice of the nature and date of such changes."
D – Change in Hospital-Medical-Surgical Coverage,"3210 Nurses may make changes for the upcoming plan year, including adding
